Nimble&#39;s shareholders who have held on to the stock for years hoping for a long-term turnaround are now left with a &quot;dud.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>In fact, this quite a common occurrence in the tech M&amp;A space. Ovide stated that based on Bloomberg data, a whopping 95 percent of acquisitions involving U.S. tech companies over the last two years have been finalized at a price that&#39;s lower than the stock&#39;s record highs.</p>\\r\\n<p>Some of the more drastic examples include <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/15/10/5905116/emc-dell-biggest-tech-merger-of-all-time\\\"><strong>Dell&#39;s</strong> acquisition of<strong> EMC</strong></a> at $24.05 which is $78.59 per share below EMC&#39;s record high of $102.64 and <b>Microsoft Corporation</b> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\\\">MSFT</a>)&#39;s <a rhef=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/16/06/8109527/microsofts-linkedin-acquisition-is-this-another-nokia-or\\\">acquisition of <strong>LinkedIn</strong></a><strong> </strong>at $196 per share versus its all time-high of $276.18.</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\tBut Why?</h3>\\r\\n<p>Ovide offered two reasons to explain this trend.</p>\\r\\n<p>First, some technology companies never recovered from their dot-com highs, including EMC&#39;s stock which peaked 17 years ago.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another explanation could be that the tech companies up for sale are merely &quot;unloved software companies whose best days seemed to be behind them.&quot; In Nimble Storage&#39;s case, perhaps management felt it &quot;wasn&#39;t worth sticking around&quot; to see if the company can bounce back from rough patches.</p>\\r\\n<p>Bottom line, Ovide suggested the trend of buying tech companies at a price below its peak isn&#39;t necessarily a disaster, but does serve as a sign of caution for investors that &quot;what goes up and then down doesn&#39;t necessarily go back up.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p><em>See Also:</em></p>\\r\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/16/12/8791328/what-happens-to-my-stock-when-the-company-gets-acquired\\\">What Happens To My Stock When The Company Gets Acquired?</a></em></p>\\r\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"Look For Strong Fundamentals When Investing In Acquisition Targets\\\">Look For Strong Fundamentals When Investing In Acquisition Targets</a></em></p>\",\n",

      "        \"content\": \"<p>Discussions were held with a panel of college students with the aim to better understand how millennials think about social media, communications, video, virtual reality, augmented reality and privacy, Loup Ventures&rsquo; Gene Munster said in a report.</p>\\r\\n<p>Their findings included important takeaways for <strong>Snap Inc </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/SNAP#NYSE\\\">SNAP</a>), <strong>Facebook Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/FB#NASDAQ\\\">FB</a>) and <strong>Apple Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\\\">AAPL</a>).</p>\\r\\n<h3><strong>Learnings From Views Of Millennials</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>Munster mentioned the following takeaways:</p>\\r\\n<li><strong>Text Is Dying</strong>: Millennials view texting as a formal mode of communication. Text is gradually being replaced by video and photos. The preferred communication platforms for texting are Snap, Facebook and Facebook's Instagram. <strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\\\">MSFT</a>)'s GroupMe came as the clear leader in the group messaging category.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Photos Rule</strong>: Millennials love Snap because they communicate through photos, there are filters and geotags to enhance those photos, and Snap is a tighter social network.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Snap Spectacles</strong>: These will become mainstream as pricing comes down.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Phones</strong>: All students in the panel wanted iPhone to be their next phone. New phones are purchased when their contract is up, which tends to be every two to 2.5 years. &ldquo;The <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/17/02/9033267/munster-apple-is-taking-baby-steps-into-augmented-realit\\\">AR features of the iPhone</a> X this fall generally did not appeal to our panelists,&rdquo; Munster wrote.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Preferred Social Networking Platform</strong>: Snap seemed to be the preferred social platform, followed by Instagram. Snap is popular for its real-time story of your day. &ldquo;We believe the camera is at the center of how Snap must advance the platform with new devices and new features to stay ahead of<a href=\\\"http://www.recode.net/2017/2/6/14489088/facebooks-ads-video-advertising-news-feed-mark-zuckerberg\\\"> Facebook&rsquo;s improved filters</a>. If Snap slows on its vision as a camera company, Facebook will likely catch them,&rdquo; the analyst commented.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>VR &amp; AR</strong>: The panelists felt that more compelling experiences were needed to drive repeat engagement with VR. None of the panelists considered AR in the next iPhone as a compelling enough feature for an upgrade.</li>\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;VR and AR have a long way to go, but we will get there. The students see the conceptual value of VR and are struggling with what&rsquo;s exciting about AR. Despite these concerns, the group has an insatiable appetite for technology. They will continue to experiment with AR even though the experiences and use cases will be limited for the next few years,&rdquo; Munster stated.</p>\\r\\n<em>Related Links:</em>\\r\\n<li><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/17/03/9118962/the-road-ahead-for-snap-what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-camera\\\">The Road Ahead For Snap: What Does It Mean To Be A Camera Company?</a></li>\\r\\n<li><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/17/03/9153375/facebook-takes-a-page-out-of-snaps-book-again\\\">Facebook Takes A Page Out Of Snap's Book...

Moreover, PayPal&#39;s merchant acceptance and geographic reach are also substantially better. It has 15 million merchants (versus ~300,000&ndash;350,000 for Visa Checkout and Masterpass) and has a presence in 200 countries (around six times higher than Masterpass, the closest competitor in this regard).</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Other leading wallets are making progress</strong>: This is particularly true for Apple Pay. In 2016, Apple Pay and Visa Checkout grew new accounts by 200 percent and 90 percent, respectively, versus only 10 percent for PayPal.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Total dollar value of transactions of major wallets</strong>: The analyst estimated the <a href=\\\"https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/28/key-metrics-how-paypal-boosts-transaction-volume.aspx\\\">wallet TPV</a> of the major players at ~$420 billion, with PayPal at $290 billion (representing ~70 percent of the total), <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/16/06/8107841/gene-munster-says-apple-pay-a-legitimate-threat-to-paypa\\\">Apple Pay at ~$60 billion</a>, and Visa Checkout, Masterpass and Amazon Payments all in the $20 billion&ndash;$25 billion range.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Wallet adoption</strong>: &ldquo;Overall, wallet adoption among U.S. adults is at scale &ndash; it appears to be in the 33&ndash;52 percent range, primarily driven by PayPal&rdquo; Ellis wrote.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Wallet usage</strong>: This continues to be low, estimated at ~2 percent of total U.S. retail volumes. &ldquo;Wallet usage within online/mobile channels is much higher &ndash; we estimate it at ~20 percent of online/mobile volume flowing through wallets,&rdquo; Ellis added.</li></ul>\\r\\n<h3>Ratings</h3>\\r\\n<ul><li>Apple: Rated Outperform, with price target at $140</li><li>MasterCard: Rated Outperform, with price target at $123</li><li>PayPal: Rated Market Perform, with price target at $44</li>\\r\\n<li>Visa: Rated Outperform, with price target at $104 and named Top Pick</li></ul>\\r\\n<p><em>Related Link:</em></p>\\r\\n<li><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/17/01/8932107/paypal-remains-a-major-beneficiary-of-the-unstoppable-gr\\\">PayPal Remains A Major Beneficiary Of The Unstoppable Growth In E-Commerce</a></li>\\r\\n<li><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/17/03/9134149/virtual-assistants-voice-technology-winners-and-losers\\\">Virtual Assistants, Voice Technology: Winners And Losers</a></em></li> \",\n",

      "        \"content\": \"Gazing into the future of operating system, or OS, Loup Ventures said a combination of <strong> Apple Inc. </strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\\\">AAPL</a>) and <strong> Microsoft Corporation </strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\\\">MSFT</a>) is likely to win the Augmented Reality, or AR OS race. The firm noted that <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/17/02/9033181/goldman-sachs-sees-increassed-likelihood-the-iphone-8-wil\\\"> Apple </a> and <strong> Alphabet Inc </strong>  (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ\\\">GOOG</a>) (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ\\\">GOOGL</a>), the prior OS winners won the mobile layer.</p>\\r\\n<h3><strong>Opportunities For New Players</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>Gene Munster, managing partner at the firm, attributed this to the well-defined shifts and the existing players carefully positioning themselves to be sure they have a seat at the table. Munster feels the future won't be owned by the incumbents, as there is a move away from purely digital technologies into ones that combine the sciences, namely biology, chemistry, psychology. This, the analyst, sees would provide opportunities for the emergence of new players.</p>\\r\\n<h3> New Computer Paradigms Keep Emerging </h3>\\r\\n<p>Loup Ventures noted that once in every 25 years a new computing paradigm keeps emerging, creating an opportunity to own a new OS layer &mdash; like the PC in the late '80s powered by Windows, Mac and Linux, the internet in the late '90s powered by <a href=\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-04/google-moves-into-augmented-reality-shopping-with-bmw-gap\\\"> Google </a> and <strong>Amazon.com, Inc.</strong>  (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\\\">AMZN</a>), mobile in the mid-2000s, owned by iOS and Android.</p>\\r\\n<h3><strong>Sharing Knowledge On AR OS Layer</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>Although Munster believes most AR functionality will happen through the existing mobile OSes, he thinks in order to drive a true paradigm shift, AR wearables will need their own OS. The analyst is of the view that there are likely to be two or three winners on that count, which would render reach and scale difficult to achieve. There is likely to be one closed OS solution and one that is open, Munster added.</p>\\r\\n<p>The leeway open systems allow for third-party developers to innovate on hardware and software features would make hardware commoditized. Munster sees definite challenges around miniaturization and battery. The analyst expects AR to be a culmination of several core disciplines such as UX design, maps, data, social, developers, content and payments.</p>\\r\\n<p>On these core disciplines, Munster noted that Google scored the highest followed by Apple, Microsoft, <strong>Facebook Inc</strong>  (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/FB#NASDAQ\\\">FB</a>), Amazon and <strong>Snap Inc</strong>  (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/SNAP#NYSE\\\">SNAP</a>). Also taking the R&D spending of these companies as proxies for their determination to make it big, Munster noted that Apple is spending the most followed by Google and Facebook.</p>\\r\\n<h3> AR OS Players And Their Status </h3>\\r\\n<ul><li><strong>Google:</strong> Discontinued Google Glass; Tango already has takers in the form of <strong>Lenovo Group Limited (ADR)</strong> (OTC:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/LNVGY#OTC\\\">LNVGY</a>)'s Phab 2 Pro and <strong>ACER INC GDR(REP 5 ORD TWD10)REG'S</strong> (OTC:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/ACEYY#OTC\\\">ACEYY</a>)'s Tango-ready phone. Google's AR OS is likely to be the winner for the open system, developing from a combination of Tango and Android, augmented by the company's machine learning efforts.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Apple:</strong> If the next iPhone integrated a dedicated 3D mapping chip, it could be the first AR hardware to gain mass adoption, enabling developers to create unique AR experiences on the iPhone. Additionally, Loup Ventures expects <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/17/02/9033267/munster-apple-is-taking-baby-steps-into-augmented-realit\\\"> Apple </a> to show off the capabilities of the chip with help from Prime Sense and Metaio, its most recent AR software acquisitions.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> Munster feels the company may be the furthest along in AR today, with the Hololens and its Windows Holographic OS. Given that the company had missed the bus in mobile OS despite being an early entrant, the company might be determined not to miss on AR. However, the company would be constrained by its inability to match up to Google in most of the core competences to win in AR, although it still holds an edge in productivity.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Loup Ventures believes Facebook is experimenting with both AR and Virtual Reality, or VR, with the focus more on VR than AR. This is understandable, given Mark Zuckerberg's view that VR is five to 10 years ahead of AR. The company's relative weakness in maps and informational data and strength in social and content make it a potential winner in the VR OS layer.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Amazon's foray into AR is not through wearables, but Alexa, an open OS. Munster sees Alexa-powered devices to eventually include cameras that will enable computer vision. The analyst feels the company might want to stamp its authority as a force in the OS layer for commerce.</li>\\r\\n<li><strong>Snap:</strong> Munster believes for Snap, communication is a key use for AR, with its camera and Spectacles. However, the analyst doesn't think Snap can win the AR race, as it can't offer incremental features beyond social to developers.</li></ul>\\r\\n<em>Related Links:</em>\\r\\n<li><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/17/02/9042578/is-ar-all-its-cracked-up-to-be\\\"> Is AR All It's Cracked Up To Be?</a></em></li>\\r\\n<li><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/16/12/8793146/the-biggest-players-in-augmented-reality\\\"> The Biggest Players In Augmented Reality </a> </em></li> \",\n",

      "        \"content\": \"<p>Ride sharing services are among the disruptive technologies the automotive sector has come to adopt. This service is pitched as a replacement for car ownership and at the same time offer personalized transportation service. The potential, the opportunity flaunts, is there for everybody to see and this explains the frenzied investment activity and competitive pressure we see in the space.</p>\\r\\n<h3><strong>What Ride Sharing Means?</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/16/11/8720442/the-winners-and-losers-of-the-gig-economy-who-benefits-from-uber-and-lyft\\\"> Ride sharing companies </a> provide taxi-like services by connecting passengers to drivers via a smartphone app. Here, the drivers use their own vehicles to share rides with others.</p>\\r\\n<h3><strong>Manufacturers, Tech Companies Vie For Piece of Market</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>Realizing the potential and the radical way in which the trend is going to affect the way cars are built, marketed and purchased, automakers have struck partnership with ride sharing companies. <strong>General Motors Company </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/GM#NYSE\\\">GM</a>) and <strong>Ford Motor Company </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/F#NYSE\\\">F</a>) have already separately made investments in <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/17/01/8973412/why-public-relations-matter-uber-vs-lyft\\\"> Lyft. </a> GM's $500 million investment in Lyft provides for it leasing vehicles to Lyft drivers in Chicago. <strong>Toyota Motor Corp (ADR)</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/TM#NYSE\\\">TM</a>) has struck a deal with Uber and has made a substantial investment in Lyft.</p>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://files.pitchbook.com/images/Ridesharing_investment_datagraphic_contrast_with_PB_logo_Ggd.png\\\"><img src=\\\"/files/images/2017/March/10/ridesharing.png\\\" width=\\\"1584\\\" height=\\\"1224\\\" alt=\\\"ridesharing.png\\\" /></a>\\r\\nSource: Pitchbook\\r\\n<p>European automakers aren't far behind. <strong>Volkswagen AG (ADR)</strong> (OTC:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/VLKAY#OTC\\\">VLKAY</a>) invested $300 million in Gett, while <strong>BAYER MOTOREN WERK ADR EACH REPR 0.33333 SHS</strong> (OTC:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/BMWYY#OTC\\\">BMWYY</a>) has invested in San Francisco-based Scoop, which provides an app connecting people in the city living in the same neighborhoods and work near one another to arrange carpools.</p>\\r\\n<p>Meanwhile, tech companies have also made a beeline to invest in ride sharing companies. <strong> Apple Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\\\">AAPL</a>) announced a $1 billion investment in Chinese ride hailing company called Didi Chuxing, which vanquished Uber in China.</p>\\r\\n<h3><strong>Uber's Chinese Dream Going Kaput</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>In August last year, Uber gave up on its Chinese ambitions, selling its Chinese business to Didi. In exchange, Uber acquired a 17.5 percent stake in the combined company and got $1 billion in cash. The deal also provided for Didi taking a small stake in Uber's global business.</p>\\r\\n<p>Uber's exit from China stemmed from the fact that its Chinese business was bleeding, with Uber's CEO Travis Kalanick estimating the loss at $1 billion per year. The freeing up of resource also meant it could focus on profitable opportunities elsewhere. Added to that, Uber was readying itself for an IPO and the exit from China would make the company more palatable to potential investors.</p>\\r\\n<p>As recently as this week, Uber was accorded regulatory permission to test its self-driving cars in its home state of California. Earlier, the company had moved its self-driving cars to Arizona, which has fewer regulations, following a standoff with the Californian regulators. However, the company is yet a long way from commercializing the service, having only two vehicles as of now under testing. </p>\\r\\n<h3><strong>Didi: The Chinese Juggernaut Rolls On</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>Didi recently opened an R&D center called Didi Labs in Mountain View, California. The company has deep pockets and clout, as is evidenced by a plethora of investments and purchases it had made across the globe. It had made a strategic investment in Ola Cabs in India, Grab in Southeast Asia and Lyft in the United States. The Chinese company has also made a $100 million investment in Brazil-based on-demand taxi service called 99.</p>\\r\\n<p>Didi Labs is supposed to work on how AI can be used for applications in its products and cybersecurity for autonomous vehicles. </p>\\r\\n<h3><strong>Run-Ins With Regulators</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>Late last year, Uber and Lyft were locked in a battle with the Seattle City Council, which had permitted the drivers of the ride sharing  services to join a union. Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft were also opposed to the city's move to get them share information to the public about things such as where passengers are picked up and dropped, just as how taxi operators are required to do. The city's contention is that these services are offering services similar to taxi cabs, while ride sharing services contend that it would mean sharing sensitive trade secrets. They tout themselves a technology companies.</p>\\r\\n<p>Earlier, both Uber and Lyft withdrew from Austin, Texas, after regulators required drivers to go through fingerprint background checks. The companies reasoned that the move would prove unjust to those drivers who had arrests long time back. </p>\\r\\n<h3><strong> Uber Accused Of Hoodwinking Regulators</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>A <a href=\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html?_r=0\\\"> New York Times report </a> recently highlighted practices engaged in by Uber to deceive regulators, who were opposed to its UberX, its low cost ride hailing service. The company reportedly uses a tool called Greyball, which helps collect data from Uber app and uses other techniques to zero in on enforcement officials involved in largescale sting operations.</p>\\r\\n<p>If a person was identified to be linked to enforcement, he was tagged with a small piece of code reading \\\"Greyball\\\" following by a string of numbers. When such a person calls a car, the company populates a fake version of the app with ghost cars or show that no car is available.</p>\\r\\n<h3> Uber Vs. Lyft </h3>\\r\\n<p>Quoting data from TXN Solutions, which tracks debit and credit card data, <a href=\\\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/03/08/lyft-uber-travis-kalanick-john-zimmer/98799804/\\\"> USA Today </a> said, in late January, Uber's share of the ride hailing market was 83.5 percent compared to 16.5 percent for Lyft. Lyft, which is eventually seeking to edge out Uber from the U.S. market, is slowly gaining traction. The steps in the direction have ironically come from Uber itself.</p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://blogs-images.forbes.com/andyswan/files/2016/08/Uber-1-1200x872.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"/files/images/2017/March/10/uber-1-1200x872.jpg\\\" width=\\\"1200\\\" height=\\\"872\\\" alt=\\\"uber-1-1200x872.jpg\\\"/></a>\\r\\nSource: Likefolio\\r\\n<p>Uber has courted a lot of controversies recently. The company faced rough weather, with the #DeleteUber campaign trending in response to the company's initial reaction to the infamous travel ban. Then, there were controversies surrounding misbehavior by its CEO, claims of sexist supervisors, the reports of the company cheating on regulators and a lawsuit alleging stealing of intellectual property.</p>\\r\\n<p>The report stated Lyft's market share rose to 20.9 percent immediately after the #DeleteUber campaign and picked up further to 21.3 percent in February in the aftermath of allegations of blatant sexism by its ex-engineer Susan Fowler. </p>\\r\\n<p>Competitive heat is soaring, as the two rivals sweat it out. And they also have other smaller players such as Sidecar to contend with. However, this could all turn positive for other stakeholders in the fray &mdash; drivers, who can look forward to bigger bonuses, and customers, who can avail huge discounts. </p>\\r\\n<p>Can the Big 2 target share at the expense of bleeding margins? These companies can afford to have a healthy, profitable survival if their share is big enough to give them economies of scale. </p>\\r\\n<p><em>Related Links:</em>\\r\\n<li><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/17/01/8973749/automakers-shift-lanes-as-disruptive-technologies-take-o\\\"> Automakers Shift Lanes As Disruptive Technologies Take Over </a> \\r\\n<li><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/17/02/8987717/tech-companies-most-exposed-to-trumps-immigration-ban\\\"> Tech Companies Most Exposed To Trump's Immigration Ban </a> \\r\\n<li><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/17/02/8986489/automakers-eye-the-finish-line-in-sprint-to-rollout-driverless-vehic\\\"> Automakers Eye The Finish Line in Sprint To Rollout Driverless Vehicle </a>  \\r\\n_______\\r\\n<em>Image Credit: By Colin@TheTruthAbout - <a href=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thetruthabout/15172340596/\\\" title=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thetruthabout/15172340596/\\\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/thetruthabout/15172340596/</a>, CC BY-SA 2.0, <a href=\\\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=36537269\\\">via Wikimedia Commons</a></em> \",\n",

According to the leaks, the CIA has developed technology that can be used to hack into <strong>SAMSUNG</strong> (OTC:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/SSNLF#OTC\\\">SSNLF</a>) TVs, <strong>Apple Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\\\">AAPL</a>) iPhones and iPads, and PCs and other devices running <strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\\\">MSFT</a>)&rsquo;s Windows operating system.</p>\\r\\n<p>Of course, the government says it would never use any of its capabilities to spy on American citizens. However, privacy advocates often compare the ever-increasing government surveillance capabilities to the rise of &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; from <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/17/01/8941118/the-fulfillment-of-orwellian-prophecy-since-1984\\\">George Orwell&rsquo;s book &ldquo;1984.&rdquo;</a></p>\\r\\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/17/03/9147962/heres-whos-getting-a-tax-cut-under-the-new-healthcare-proposal-youre-probably-not\\\">Here&#39;s Who&#39;s Getting A Tax Cut Under The New Healthcare Proposal (You&#39;re Probably Not Included)</a></em></p>\\r\\n<p>If the Wikileaks hack is, in fact, evidence that 2017 may be the real-life &ldquo;1984,&rdquo; perhaps the book can shed some light on what kinds of things Americans should be watching out for next. Here are a few plot points from the book that some argue may have already begun to come true.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\tIn &quot;1984,&quot; the Brotherhood Party watches citizens wherever they go. This part of the plot is seemingly the closest to reality, according to the Wikileaks documents. While the government says it doesn&#39;t monitor citizen&rsquo;s personal activities in their homes or on their phones, it certainly seems to have the capability to do so.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\tIn &quot;1984,&quot; the government re-writes history and even manipulates the language in an attempt to stave-off potential rebellion. While U.S. citizens still have full freedom of speech, the current administration&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;alternative facts&rdquo; may be a red flag that the integrity of the media should be closely monitored.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\tIn &quot;1984,&quot; the government prohibits sex and discourages individuality. Like all other elements of the story, how closely it applies to <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/17/03/9133962/3-potential-outcomes-for-the-debt-dilemma-according-to-d\\\">today&rsquo;s situation</a> in the U.S. is open to interpretation. The groundbreaking 2015 Supreme Court ruling in favor of gay marriage was certainly a step toward freedom of sexual expression and individuality. However, the recent ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries could be interpreted as a step in the opposite direction.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\tThe dramatic conclusion of &ldquo;1984&rdquo; involves government brainwashing citizens to get them to conform. In the book, the government turns the protagonist&rsquo;s biggest fears against him in an attempt to get him to abandon his personal ideals. Once again, applying this element to today&rsquo;s America is a matter of personal opinion. There&rsquo;s no question that politicians in both parties have used fear tactics regarding terrorism, immigration, gun violence, employment, <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/17/03/9147962/heres-whos-getting-a-tax-cut-under-the-new-healthcare-proposal-youre-probably-not\\\">healthcare</a> and even socioeconomic class warfare to scare voters into choosing sides. While politicians throughout the ages have always recognized that fear is a strong motivator, Americans concerned about governmental power may have taken note of just how much of the 2016 campaign season was devoted to stirring up fears.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Is &ldquo;1984&rdquo; coming true in real life? Obviously there&rsquo;s no way to answer that question definitively. But following the latest Wikileaks document dump, it seems reasonable for Americans to be concerned.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Image Credit: By Jordan L&#39;H&ocirc;te - Own work, CC BY 3.0, <a href=\\\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=15212492\\\">via Wikimedia Commons</a></em></p>\\r\\n \",\n",

WeChat</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>If you think Snapchat&rsquo;s 158 million users is impressive, WeChat&rsquo;s 700 million-plus user-base is mind-blowing. The WeChat app is owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent and is most similar to <strong>Facebook Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/FB#NASDAQ\\\">FB</a>)&rsquo;s WhatsApp.</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\t<strong>2. QQ</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>QQ is also owned by Tencent. Because it has been around for quite a while, it may be the most recognizable Chinese internet brand. The mobile app is most similar to <strong>Yahoo Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/YHOO#NASDAQ\\\">YHOO</a>).</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\t<strong>3. Mobile Baidu</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p><strong>Baidu Inc (ADR)</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/BIDU#NASDAQ\\\">BIDU</a>) is well known as the dominant search engine in China. Its mobile app has a 90 percent market share and is obviously most similar to <strong>Alphabet Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ\\\">GOOGL</a>)&rsquo;s Google app.</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\t<strong>4. Taobao</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>Taobao is the top mobile shopping app in China. The app is owned by <strong>Alibaba Group Holding Ltd</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/BABA#NYSE\\\">BABA</a>) and is most similar to <strong>eBay Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/EBAY#NASDAQ\\\">EBAY</a>).</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\t<strong>5. UC Browser</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>UC Browser is the top internet browser of choice for Chinese mobile users. The UC Browser app is also owned by Alibaba and is similar to <strong>Apple Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\\\">AAPL</a>)&rsquo;s Safari.</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\t<strong>6. QQ Browser</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>UC Browser&rsquo;s top competition in China is Tencent&rsquo;s QQ Browser. The browser&rsquo;s second-place standing makes is most similar to Google Chrome in the U.S.</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\t<strong>7. Tencent Video</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>In recent years, the Tencent Video app surpassed popular video platform YouKu in terms of mobile market share. Sitting atop the throne of mobile video makes Tencent Video the YouTube of China.</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\t<strong>8. Sogou Mobile</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>Sogou is Baidu&rsquo;s biggest rival when it comes to mobile search engine market share.

And we&rsquo;ll be looking for signs of these new features in iOS 11 when it&rsquo;s introduced at WWDC in early June.

      "        \"content\": \"<p>When it comes to the environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing theme, investors have a growing number of options among equity-based exchange traded funds.</p>\\r\\n<p>The &ldquo;E&rdquo; in ESG is particularly easy to access as investors can find ETFs that do everything from exclude the energy sector to focusing on companies with low carbon footprints. Until now, green investing via ETFs for fixed income investors has been more difficult. The newly minted <b>VanEck Vectors Green Bond ETF</b> (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/GRNB#NYSE\\\">GRNB</a>) changes that.</p>\\r\\n<p>GRNB debuted almost two weeks ago as the first ETF dedicated to green bonds. GRNB follows the S&amp;P Green Bond Select Index, which is &ldquo;is comprised of labeled green bonds that are issued to finance environmentally friendly projects, and includes bonds issued by supranational, government, and corporate issuers globally in multiple currencies,&rdquo; according to VanEck.</p>\\r\\n<p>While GRNB is new, its index is a little more seasoned, having debuted in 2014. And while green bonds may sound like a niche segment of the massive overall bond market, there&#39;s no denying the growth in issuance of these bonds. Last year, $82 billion in green bonds were issued and that number is expected to jump to $150 billion this year, <a href=\\\"https://www.vaneck.com/etf/income/grnb/overview/\\\">according to VanEck</a>.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;However, the speed and momentum at which the green bond market can develop in 2017 and beyond depends on multiple variables, including policy and regulatory factors, market conditions, and financing trend,&rdquo; said <a href=\\\"http://www.indexologyblog.com/2017/03/10/the-rise-of-green-bonds/\\\">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices</a>. &ldquo;It faces a range of specific challenges and barriers, such as underdeveloped domestic bond markets, issuers&rsquo; views on costs versus benefits, a mismatch between projects, bonds, and institutional investors, and a lack of commonly accepted green standards and definitions.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>GRNB has an effective duration of 6.3 years and a yield to worst of 1.66 percent. The new ETF holds 41 bonds, including issues from <b>Apple Inc.</b> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\\\">AAPL</a>) and <b>Bank of America Corp.</b> (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/BAC#NYSE\\\">BAC</a>) as well as green debt issued by European companies and governments.</p>\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;Increasingly, market participants are calling for more alignment and single metrics for green bond assessments to speed up market growth,&rdquo; said S&amp;P Dow Jones. &ldquo;Over the course of 2017, we can expect to see further standardization and alignment of green bond assessment frameworks.&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n\",\n",

She would report to David Brinker, who joined the company in October to oversee business development related to Snap&#39;s content efforts. Prior to joining Snapchat, Brinker was employed as the President of the New York Post.</p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/introducing-discover/\\\">Snapchat</a> launched the Discover feature in January 2015 and was seen as the company&#39;s thrust to capitalize on the paradigm &ndash; content is king. TechCrunch termed the feature as an always-on, daily refreshed channel guide distributing content, with brand advertisements thrown around it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Snapchat, according to Recode, is finicky about the publishers it will work with. Consequently, many content creators or publishers were rejected in the past. Snap is now forcing its publishers to create exclusive content such as shows, short TV-like episodes.</p>\\r\\n<p>Recode also reported Snap might seek to license some of this content, just so it can avoid sharing revenues.</p>\\r\\n<p>Though Ogier&#39;s role isn&#39;t clear, it&#39;s believed she might be liaising with Snapchat&#39;s publishing partners, the same role she donned at Apple.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>See Also:</em></p>\\r\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/17/03/9146608/snap-falls-below-opening-price-how-long-did-twitter-and-\\\">Snap Falls Below Opening Price; How Long Did Twitter And Facebook Take To Do The Same? </a></em></p>\\r\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/17/03/9153375/facebook-takes-a-page-out-of-snaps-book-again\\\">Facebook Takes A Page Out Of Snap&#39;s Book...

The company became privy to the ALJ ruling just prior to the start of the ITC hearing, which was originally scheduled to begin on Monday.</p>\\r\\n<p>In December 2016, ParkerVision filed a complaint with the ITC, alleging that <strong> Apple Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\\\">AAPL</a>), Qualcomm, <strong> LG ELECTRONICS INC KRW5000 </strong> (OTC:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/LGEAF#OTC\\\">LGEAF</a>) and <strong>SAMSUNG</strong> had infringed upon certain wireless networking patents.</p>\\r\\n<p>The company clarified Monday&#39;s decision to terminate is despite its preparedness to try its case based on evidence collected from respondents, which goes on to prove the accused products infringe the asserted claims of the &#39;528 patent.</p>\\r\\n<p>This termination, according to the company, would allow it to request removal of the current stay on the proceedings in two U.S. district court cases against Qualcomm and certain of its customers. Furthermore, this action has no impact on the ongoing infringement proceedings against LG and Apple in Germany, the company added.</p>\\r\\n<p>&quot;While we are disappointed that we were not allowed to present key evidence that could significantly impact the outcome of this case, we believe the termination of these proceedings is the appropriate strategic decision for the Company.

For this installment, we spoke<strong> Ted Devine</strong>, CEO of Insureon (answers have been edited for length and clarity).</em></p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\t<a href=\\\"http://www.insureon.com/\\\">Insureon</a></h3>\\r\\n<p><strong>What does your company do? What unique problem does it solve?</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>About 40 percent of small businesses have no insurance and 75 percent are significantly underinsured. That&#39;s a problem when something goes wrong and a business is faced with an unexpected bill, but it can also hamper growth. To get a commercial lease, for example, you almost always need a general liability insurance policy. And to work with big, high-paying clients, you&#39;ll usually need to show proof of E&amp;O coverage.</p>\\r\\n<p>But small businesses have always had trouble finding insurance. There are a few reasons why:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\tSmall commercial insurance policies aren&#39;t that expensive &ndash; often $500 per year or less. That&#39;s great for business owners, but means agents may not be motivated to do the work required to write these policies, given the relatively small potential premium and commission.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\tLocal agents may have access to only one insurance company. If that company doesn&#39;t offer coverage for your business, you&#39;re out of luck.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\tLocal agents can only do so much, so they may not have expertise writing for your industry. That means they may not know ways to save money or questions to ask to make sure your risks are truly covered.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Insureon solves this by partnering with more than 100 carriers to cover businesses in more than 500 industries. Our proprietary technology means a business from anywhere in the country can apply online in just a few minutes and get access to the carriers that offer the coverage they need.</p>\\r\\n<p>Our commitment to best-in-class customer service means that every business we work with gets to talk to an agent who specializes in their industry before they choose a policy.</p>\\r\\n<p>Helping our customers understand how insurance fits into their overall business plan is important to us, so we also offer tools to help small-business owners understand their risk exposure and how to minimize it. One example is Policy Buddy, which a two-minute diagnostic that highlights policies a business is likely to need.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Who are your customers?</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>Insureon serves the large market of solopreneurs, micro-businesses, and companies with up to 20 employees. According to the SBA, there are over 25 million of these small businesses in the United States. Our customers span more than 500 industries, from IT professionals and consultants to small dentists and accounting practices.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>How long have you been in business?</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>Insureon&#39;s roots go back to 1997, when the TechInsurance Group formed to offer small technology firms an online destination for buying business insurance. In 2011, the TechInsurance Group launched Insureon, which is now a leading online destination for any small business insurance needs, regardless of industry. Since founding, Insureon has helped more than 250,000 small businesses find coverage.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Where are you located?</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>We are headquartered in Chicago with offices in Texas and San Francisco.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Who is your company&#39;s leadership? What kind of experience do they have?</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>Before Insureon, I held senior level positions at Aon Corporation where I was President of Aon Risk Services, which had more than $5 billion in revenue and 28,000 employees worldwide. Before Aon, I spent 12 years as Director of McKinsey &amp; Company and am also the Founder and CEO of 1WORLD Sports, a Chicago-based nonprofit dedicated to inspiring at-risk youth to excel on and off the playing field.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jeff Somers is the President and Head of Retail at Insureon. Jeff joined Insureon in 2016 from a position as Chief Product Officer at<strong> Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/LYV#NYSE\\\">LYV</a>)&#39;s Ticketmaster, where he led a 150-plus person team dedicated to the end-to-end optimization of client experiences.

Yuri oversees technology, engineering, development, and quality assurance for Insureon.

      "        \"content\": \"<p>It&rsquo;s a generally a quiet time of the year for earnings and a lot of focus is on The Fed&rsquo;s March meeting, but tech heavyweight <strong><span>Oracle Corporation</span></strong><span> (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/ORCL#NYSE\\\">ORCL</a>) </span>earnings come out after market close today. Going into earnings, Oracle&rsquo;s stock price is up a little over 11% year-to-date and has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) by just over 5%. But this is after underperforming the SPX by over 5% in 2016 and lagging the SPX by a substantial 18.8% in 2015.</p>\\r\\n<p>Oracle&rsquo;s earnings growth and stock performance has lagged the software industry&rsquo;s for several years. Some analysts thought this was due to concerns over the company&rsquo;s ability to transition its core business from declining hardware and software sales to cloud-based products. This has been a similar challenge facing other legacy tech companies like<strong> <span>Cisco Systems, Inc.</span></strong><span> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/CSCO#NASDAQ\\\">CSCO</a>)</span> and <strong><span>Microsoft Corporation</span></strong><span> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\\\">MSFT</a>)</span>. Oracle&rsquo;s total cloud revenue grew 62% year-over-year, to $1.05 billion, in the 2<sup>nd</sup> quarter &nbsp;and offset the enterprise database giant&rsquo;s 10% decline in hardware revenues and 4% decline in on-premise software revenues to keep total revenue flat to last year.</p>\\r\\n<p>In its last earnings release, Oracle issued less optimistic projections than it normally does and the company&rsquo;s earnings and revenue growth have faced downward pressure from a strong US dollar.</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\tBuying Up The Cloud</h3>\\r\\n<p>Oracle has made 40 acquisitions since 2012. Its most recent major acquisition was NetSuite for $9.3 billion in the second-half of 2016, which was its largest acquisition since it bought PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion in 2005. This will be the first full quarter that Oracle&rsquo;s earnings include recent acquisition NetSuite&rsquo;s results&mdash;which sells enterprise resource planning, or ERP, software. The acquisition could help Oracle strengthen its competitive position against other cloud-based companies&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"appbar-snippet-secondary\\\">\\r\\n\\t<span>like <strong>salesforce.com, inc.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/CRM#NYSE\\\">CRM</a>)</span>.</div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"appbar-snippet-secondary\\\">\\r\\n\\tRobert Weiler, the head of Oracle&rsquo;s Global Business Units group, said in a recent interview with Fortune Magazine&nbsp; &ldquo;we would only look for something that&rsquo;s in the cloud,&rdquo; when asked what he looks for in an acquisition.</div>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\tStacking Up Against The Competition</h3>\\r\\n<p>Competition in the tech sector shows no signs of slowing anytime soon among cloud-based and program-based companies like Salesforce and Oracle. The recurring subscription revenues and built in demand due to the need for continual upgrades with these products make them attractive areas for growth that companies will continue to invest in. But the more attractive the growth opportunity, the more attractive it is to the competition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Oracle has made it very clear that Infrastructure as a Service, the cloud market that has so far been dominated by<strong> <span>Amazon.com, Inc.</span></strong><span> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\\\">AMZN</a>)</span> Web Services and Microsoft, is going to be a big focus for the company in the future. In 2016 at the Oracle OpenWorld conference, Oracle&rsquo;s Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison said: &ldquo;Amazon is going to have serious competition going forward. And we are very proud of our second generation Infrastructure as a Service. We are going to be very aggressively focusing and aggressively featuring it. Not only at OpenWorld but for the rest of this fiscal year, and the next fiscal year and the year after that.&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n<p>The IaaS unit of Oracle&rsquo;s cloud business only grew 6% in the last quarter compared to 81% growth in the company&rsquo;s PaaS (Platform as a service), and SaaS (Software as a Service).</p>\\r\\n<p>One of Oracle&rsquo;s main competitors in cloud computing is Amazon Web Services, Amazon&rsquo;s subsidiary that provides a suite of cloud computing services. Amazon Web Services reported $3.53 billion in revenue for Q4 2016, up 47% from Q4 2015. To put that into perspective, Amazon&rsquo;s cloud business is more than three times larger than Oracle&rsquo;s in their most recent quarters.</p>\\r\\n<p>Can Oracle can keep up the rapid growth in its cloud business? The Q3 consensus earnings estimate from third-party Wall Street analysts is $0.62 a share, according to the Earnings Analysis tab on the thinkorswim&reg; platform from TD&nbsp;Ameritrade. Revenue is projected to increase to $9.22 billion, from $9.01 billion in Q3 last year.</p>\\r\\n<p>The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 3.2% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move&trade; indicator on the thinkorswim&reg; platform.</p>\\r\\n<p>Calls have been active at the weekly 43 and 44 strikes while puts have seen activity at the 42 strike. The implied volatility sits at the 40<sup>th</sup> percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.)</p>\\r\\n<p><i>Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.</i></p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/imce?app=nomatter%7Cimceload@imceInline.load#\\\" onclick=\\\"imce.send('screen_shot_2017-03-15_at_11.08.07_am.png'); return false;\\\" title=\\\"Insert file\\\"><img alt=\\\"screen_shot_2017-03-15_at_11.08.07_am.png\\\" height=\\\"712\\\" src=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u105576/screen_shot_2017-03-15_at_11.08.07_am.png\\\" width=\\\"784\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\tLooking Ahead</h3>\\r\\n<p>We&rsquo;re not even close to the height of earnings season and there&rsquo;s still over a month to go before earnings from Oracle&rsquo;s main competitors like Microsoft, <strong><span>International Business Machines Corp.</span></strong><span> (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"/stock/IBM#NYSE\\\">IBM</a>)</span> and Salesforce. While investors will be keeping a close eye on Oracle&rsquo;s cloud growth in Q3, they&rsquo;ll want to see how it stacks up to the competition. There&rsquo;s a lot of big players focused on cloud computing and they have the resources to go after pretty much any attractive growth opportunity in the space. It could be a while before the dust settles and we see who the cloud computing leaders will be.</p>\\r\\n \",\n",

In fact, Apple has become an leader in the online wireless headphone market and now accounts for 26 percent of sales in the sector, according to a <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/17/01/8905379/apples-airpod-success-headphone-users-show-theyre-willing-to-cut-the-cord\\\">recent data</a> from Slice Intelligence.</p>\\r\\n<p>As a whole, 75 percent of headphones sold online in the month of December were wireless, Slice said. Apple accounts for another 15.4 percent of the sector due to its ownership of the Beats brand, which led the sector prior to the introduction of AirPod.</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Airpods &ndash; The Hearables</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>Murphy calls voice-controlled wearables, like AirPods, as &ldquo;hearables.&rdquo; He said AirPods represents a giant leap forward for audio as a user interface and is a key enabler of AR (augmented reality) technology.</p>\\r\\n<p>Murphy noted that using AirPods necessarily means using your phone less frequently, or at least pulling it out of your purse or your pocket less frequently.</p>\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;AirPods can handle information requests, dictation, media control, and phone calls; meanwhile, quick glances at the Apple Watch on your wrist will suffice for most notifications. All of this means that your phone stays in your pocket,&rdquo; Murphy wrote.</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Survey Findings</strong></h3>\\r\\n<p>Loup Ventures surveyed 55 AirPods users to better understand the state of the early hearables market. The findings showed <a href=\\\"http:// https://www.benzinga.com/tech/16/09/8478299/3-major-flaws-with-apples-airpods\\\">AirPods</a> received a net promoter score (NPS) of -2, which means the number of detractors, passives and promoters were split roughly in thirds, with slightly more detractors than promoters.</p>\\r\\n<p>Among detractors and passives, half identified the ear fit as the opportunity for improvement, not the software or functionality.</p>\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;AirPods <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/16/09/8456778/tim-cook-swats-at-apple-airpods-concerns\\\">may not be perfect</a>, but they&rsquo;ll get better, smarter, and easier to use.

Analysts typically examine Apple&#39;s supply chain for any sort of signs that can lead to a conclusion on iPhone sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>For example, if companies within Apple&#39;s supply chain - which is said to be the <a href=\\\"http://www.recode.net/2016/8/30/12700248/apple-success-secret-supply-chain-manufacturing-tim-cook\\\">most efficient</a> in the world - report higher revenue then it&#39;s logical to conclude the companies were busy fulfilling incremental products for Apple.This happened to be case, according to Jankowski, as the simple average of quarterly year-over-year growth of six of Apple&#39;s biggest suppliers in China and Taiwan were indeed higher in the first quarter.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jankowski did note this methodology is more of a &quot;directional guide&quot; and not a precise forecast.</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\tStrong Seasonality In February</h3>\\r\\n<p>The six suppliers the analyst tracks reported sales were high by 27 percent year-over-year in February and down 18 percent month-over-month versus a three-year average month-over-month seasonality of down 34 percent.</p>\\r\\n<p>Moreover, the trailing two-month sales period for January and February were 16 percent higher on a year-over-year basis.</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n\\tChina&#39;s MIIT</h3>\\r\\n<p>Finally, the analyst noted that based on China&#39;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology&#39;s (MIIT) monthly data report, smartphone shipments in China rose 12 percent on a year-over-year basis during the first two months of 2017 to 72.8 million.</p>\\r\\n<p>The reports also stated Android shipments rose just 5 percent to 58.3 million and non-Android shipments soared 50 percent to 14.5 million.</p>\\r\\n<p>This could point to a rebound in iPhone shipments in China, as iPhones comprise the majority of non Android shipments; however, the data-set can be volatile,&quot; the analyst concluded.</p>\\r\\n<p>The stock traded recently above $140.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>See Also:</em></p>\\r\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/17/03/9174931/apples-airpods-are-the-first-mass-market-hearable\\\">Apple&#39;s Airpods Are The First Mass Market &#39;Hearable&#39;</a></em></p>\\r\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/17/03/9165497/why-apple-is-the-biggest-winner-of-trumps-infrastructure-plan\\\">Why Apple Is The Biggest Winner Of Trump&#39;s Infrastructure Plan</a></em></p>\",\n",
